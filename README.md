Since LeetCode doesn't allow us to open a previous submission and have an attempt window open at the same time, it's quite hard to refer to your previous answer while re-trying a question.
Also, the only way to mark your "model" answer is to add a note to it in the submissions panel, which is kinda iffy and you might just get confused with multple "model" answer notes. In the end, I just decided to make a repo with my "model" answers for easier reference.
This repo only contains the code, the explanations are all in my iPad hehe.
Anyways explanations are easily all over the web by creators like NeetCode so yeah.
